1.What do you mean by attributes in html are enumerated?
Enumerated data-typed means the attribute has a set of values and has a default value.

2.What is React element at the end of the day? -> Its a JS Object.

3.We can just use React to only our search bar if we want in our entire application; we need to make our search bar bar as root element in that case

4.Mostly we have only one root in our React application

5.<div id="root">
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>
<h1 id="footer">Footer</h1>
.
.
.
root.render(heading);

In the above case the multiple Hello s gets rendered first and React quickly repaints those Hello s with heading element as root.render(heading) is mentioned

->Why that lag? Because for React and ReactDOM to load it takes some milliseconds right, until then html file will be executed from top to bottom and would have encountered
root element and rendered multiple Hello s inside root. Then when script tags are loaded when root.render happens, then heading element gets injected to root(repainting the multiple Hello s)

->How to minimize this lag? Actually one cant, it can only be reduced to min millisecond

6.React was built with the thought that we should be able to write html and css inside our js file...

7.As and when the application grows larger it becomes harder and harder to use React.createElement() for creating every element or nested elements, hence JSX came into picture
